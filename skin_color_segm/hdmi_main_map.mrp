  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

WARNING:Security:43 - No license file was found in the standard Xilinx license
directory.
WARNING:Security:44 - Since no license file was found,
WARNING:Security:42 - Your software subscription period has lapsed. Your current
version of Xilinx tools will continue to function, but you no longer qualify for
Xilinx software updates or new releases.
WARNING:MapLib:701 - Signal clk100 connected to top level port clk100 has been
   removed.
WARNING:MapLib:39 - The timing specification "PERIOD=10000 pS HIGH 50%" on net
   "clk100" has been discarded, because the net was optimized out of the design.
WARNING:Pack:2768 - At least one timing constraint is impossible to meet because component switching limit violations have been detected for
   a constrained component. A timing constraint summary below shows the failing constraints (preceded with an Asterisk (*)). Please use the
   Timing Analyzer (GUI) or TRCE (command line) with the Mapped NCD and PCF files to evaluate the component switching limit violations in
   more detail. Evaluate the datasheet for alternative configurations for the component that could allow the frequencies requested in the
   constraint. Otherwise, the timing constraint covering this component might need to be modified to satisfy the component switching limits
   specified in the datasheet.

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
---------------------------------
 646 block(s) removed
   2 block(s) optimized away
 950 signal(s) removed

Section 5 - Removed Logic
-------------------------

The trimmed logic report below shows the logic removed from your design due to
sourceless or loadless signals, and VCC or ground connections.  If the removal
of a signal or symbol results in the subsequent removal of an additional signal
or symbol, the message explaining that second removal will be indented.  This
indentation will be repeated as a chain of related logic is removed.

To quickly locate the original cause for the removal of a chain of logic, look
above the place where that logic is listed in the trimming report, then locate
the lines that are least indented (begin at the leftmost edge).

Section 10 - Timing Report
--------------------------
A logic-level (pre-route) timing report can be generated by using Xilinx static
timing analysis tools, Timing Analyzer (GUI) or TRCE (command line), with the
mapped NCD and PCF files. Please note that this timing report will be generated
using estimated delay information. For accurate numbers, please generate a
timing report with the post Place and Route NCD file.

For more information about the Timing Analyzer, consult the Xilinx Timing
Analyzer Reference Manual; for more information about TRCE, consult the Xilinx
Command Line Tools User Guide "TRACE" chapter.
